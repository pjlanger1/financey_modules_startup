# financey_modules_startup

I wrote this to help a start-up amortize costs of subscription commitments, as an input to further FP&A models.
Some of the functionality is specific to idiosyncratic factors in their data, 
but the code just iterates through rows of data, creates a scaffold of dates in scope (in column space) and populates them.
